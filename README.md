# Getbox

## Installation

getbox requires the [edge version](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit) of capybara-webkit. It's in the Gemfile, but not supported by the `.gemspec`. Use Bundler.

## Usage

After checking out the repo, run `bundle` to install dependencies. Then, run `exe/getbox` for an interactive prompt that will take you through exporting your gists.
